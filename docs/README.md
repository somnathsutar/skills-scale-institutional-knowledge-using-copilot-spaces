# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub. This folder centralizes the team’s processes, roles, and best practices to make project delivery consistent, searchable, and easy to onboard to.

OctoAcme follows a lightweight, iterative lifecycle: Initiation (one‑pager and stakeholder alignment), Planning (kickoff, prioritized backlog, Definition of Done, release plan), Execution & Tracking (timeboxed sprints, PR/CI gates, and demos), Release & Deployment (pre‑release checks, rollback plans, smoke tests), and Close & Retrospective (blameless learnings and action items). Core artifacts — the Project One‑pager, roadmap, sprint backlog, acceptance criteria, risk register, and retrospective notes — act as the single source of truth for decisions and status.

Workflows emphasize small, shippable increments and rigorous quality gates: use a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), create small PRs with linked issues and acceptance criteria, run CI (tests, linting, security scans) before requesting review, and require approvals per team policy. Releases are categorized (patch/minor/major) and follow a deployment checklist with staging smoke tests, rollback plans, and post‑deploy verification.

Roles and communication are explicit to reduce ambiguity: Project Managers coordinate delivery, Product Managers define outcomes and metrics, Developers implement and test, QA validates acceptance, and stakeholders provide approvals. Team rhythm includes short daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, sprint demos, and periodic stakeholder updates. Risks are captured in a living Risk Register, reviewed weekly, and escalated through a defined path. Retrospectives drive continuous improvement, converting top action items into backlog work and measuring impact.
